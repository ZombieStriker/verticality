## Introduction

Verticality is a heavily modified game server system that interacts with Minecraft clients to allow for a completely new
gameplay experience while allowing the client to utilize base-game assets. Using the Minestom server framework,
Verticality allows server owners more creative liberty to redefine the mechanics of the sandbox game to better suit the
creator's vision.

While it is encouraged for server owners or developers use the (*planned) scripting and config systems to alter the
server to meet their needs, Verticality will allow for ease of use, plug-and-play mechanics out of the box. The goal is
to allow server owners to run the server without needing to do any extra configuration to have a functioning server that
they can utilize and test.

## Installation and setup

To install, grab the pre-compiled jar from
the  [GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/ZombieStriker/verticality/releases).

Drag and drop the server jar file into its own directory (which will be the directory the server will use to store all
datafiles for the server). From there,
like most PaperMC or SpigotMC servers, use a default run command (like what is provided below) to start running the
server.

```bat
java -jar verticality.jar
pause
```
